# Sleek Home Assignment
In this assignment I was asked to analyze the CICIDS2017 [dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)

In the assignment, I'm importing the dataset, conducting comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving three
compelling insights.

I split my work into three section:
1. [EDA](https://github.com/traviv/sleek_home_assignment/tree/main/EDA) - cleaning and analyzing the data
2. [ML](https://github.com/traviv/sleek_home_assignment/tree/main/ML%20Anomaly%20Detection) - Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest
3. [DL](https://github.com/traviv/sleek_home_assignment/tree/main/DL%20Multi-Label%20Classification) - Multi-Label classifier with Feed-Forward Neural Network
4. [ML](https://github.com/traviv/sleek_home_assignment/tree/main/ML%20Feature%20Importance) - Multi-Label classifier and Features Importance with XGboost

Each part seperated in a different repository 

In each repository, there's a Jupyter notebook with the relevant code and an explanation of my decisions and insights
