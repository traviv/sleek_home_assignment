# Sleek Home Assignment
In this assignment I was asked to analyze the CICIDS2017 [dataset](https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2017.html)

In the assignment, I'm importing the dataset, conducting comprehensive exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deriving three
compelling insights.

I split my work into three section:
1. EDA - cleaning and analyzing the data
2. ML - Anomaly Detection with Isolation Forest
3. DL - Multi-Label classifier with Feed-Forward Neural Network
4. ML - Multi-Label classifier and Features Importance with XGboost

All sections are in the Jupyter Notebook 

Each part is described in a separate PDF file with decisions and insights explained
